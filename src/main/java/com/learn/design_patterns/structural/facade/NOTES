Use Cases:
	1. Facade means face of the building which is visible from the street.
	2. Simply put, a facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface. It hides much of the complexity and makes the subsystem easy to use.
	3. It decouples a client implementation from the complex subsystem. Thanks to this, we can make changes to the existing subsystem and donâ€™t affect a client.
