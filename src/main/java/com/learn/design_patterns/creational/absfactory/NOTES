Use cases:
	1. When the underlying factories undergo frequent changes we would require abstraction which this pattern provides.
	2. Use it when the system consists of multiple families of objects, and these families are designed to be used together
	3. We need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency.
PitFalls:
	1. Increases complexity of the system.
