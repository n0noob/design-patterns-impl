NOTES:
	1. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.
	2. The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components.
