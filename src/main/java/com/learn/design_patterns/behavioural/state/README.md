# State Pattern
## Key points
* The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.
* A state allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* There shall be a separate concrete class per possible state of an object. Each concrete state object will have logic to accept or reject a state transition request based on itâ€™s present state and context information passed to it as method arguments.
