Use Cases:
	1. Used when an object creation is expensive. This design pattern makes use of clone method.
	2. It is used to remove a bunch of boilerplate code, when the configuration required would be onerous.
Pitfalls:
	1. Each concrete classes must implement the clone() operation when classes under consideration already exist.
