NOTES : 
	1. We have to add a function which accepts the visitor class to each element of the structure.

	2. That way our components will allow the visitor implementation to “visit” them and perform any required action on that element.

	3. In other words, we’ll extract the algorithm which will be applied to the object structure from the classes.

	4. Consequently, we’ll make good use of the Open/Closed principle as we won’t modify the code, but we’ll still be able to extend the functionality by providing a new Visitor implementation.
