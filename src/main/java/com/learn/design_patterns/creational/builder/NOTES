Use Cases:
	1. The Builder Design Pattern helps us to slice the operations of building an object. It focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. It also enforces a process to create an object as a finished product. That means an object has to be massaged by some instructed steps before it is ready and can be used by others.
	2. Used when object creation is very complex and require a lot of parameters.
	3. Final Object is immutable.
Pitfalls:
	1. Complex code thus introduced after Builder pattern increases complexity.
	2. Not much usefull if you want final object to be mutable.
