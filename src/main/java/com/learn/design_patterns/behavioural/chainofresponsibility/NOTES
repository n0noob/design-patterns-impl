NOTES:
	1. Wikipedia defines Chain of Responsibility as a design pattern consisting of “a source of command objects and a series of processing objects”.

	2. Each processing object in the chain is responsible for a certain type of command, and the processing is done, it forwards the command to the next processor in the chain.
